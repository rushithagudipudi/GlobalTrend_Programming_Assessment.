Questions
1. Implement a Python class MaxHeap that supports the following operations: insert, delete, and get_max. Ensure the operations maintain the properties of a max-heap.

2. Write a Python function that takes a list of URLs, attempts to download their content, and retries up to 3 times if an error occurs. Use appropriate error handling to manage different types of exceptions.

3. Write a Python script that trains a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn. Use a dataset of your choice, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluate the model's performance.

4. Using pandas, write a Python function to clean and preprocess a given DataFrame, which involves handling missing values, normalizing numerical columns, and encoding categorical columns.

5. Write a Python function to compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

6. Write a Python function that divides two numbers and handles the case where the divisor is zero by returning a custom error message.

7. Write a Python decorator that measures the execution time of a function and logs it. Apply this decorator to a function that performs a computationally expensive task.

8. Write a Python function that takes two numbers and an operator (as a string) and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

9. Write a Python function that generates a random password. The password should contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

10. Write a Python function that takes a 2D list (matrix) and returns its transpose.
